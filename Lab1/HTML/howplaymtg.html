                        <li>Deck: Each player needs a deck of at least 60 cards. These cards are divided into two main types: spells and lands.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Spells: These are the cards that represent creatures, spells, and various other effects that you can use to interact with the game.</li>

                <p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Shuffle Decks: Shuffle your deck thoroughly, ensuring a random distribution of cards.</li>
                        <li>Determine First Player: Decide who goes first. You can flip a coin or use other methods.</li>
                        <li>Draw Opening Hands: Each player draws seven cards from their shuffled deck. If a player doesn't like their opening hand, they can take a "mulligan" and draw a new hand with one fewer card. This process can be repeated until a satisfactory hand is drawn.</li>
                    </ol>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Untap Phase: Untap all tapped cards (usually lands and creatures).</li>
                                <li>Upkeep Phase: Resolve any effects that occur during this phase (rarely used).</li>
                                <li>Draw Phase: Draw a card from your deck.</li>
                                <li>Main Phase 1: Play land cards (one per turn) and cast spells. You can also use abilities of permanents (cards on the battlefield) during this phase.</li>
                                <li>Combat Phase: If you have creatures on the battlefield, you can attack your opponent during this phase. Combat involves declaring attackers, declaring blockers, and resolving damage.</li>
                                <li>Main Phase 2: Similar to Main Phase 1, you can cast spells and use abilities during this phase.</li>
                                <li>End Step: Resolve any effects that occur at the end of the turn (rarely used).</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Mana: To cast spells, you need mana. You get mana by tapping land cards. Each land card typically produces one mana of a specific color. Some cards can produce multiple colors of mana or other types of resources.</li>
                        <li>Casting Spells: You can cast spells from your hand by paying their mana cost, which is indicated on the card. Some spells have additional requirements or restrictions.</li>
                        <li>Creatures: Creatures are a central element of the game. They have power and toughness values that determine their strength in combat. When you attack, your opponent can choose to block with their creatures.</li>
                        <li>Life Total: The primary objective is to reduce your opponent's life total to zero. You can attack your opponent directly or indirectly through their creatures.</li>
                        <li>Special Abilities: Many cards have special abilities that can change the course of the game. These abilities are explained on the cards themselves.</li>
