                        The only card of the five that was not printed in alpha. It was printed in the set Urza's saga 5 years after Alpha(the first set).
                        It is also the second most expensive after black lotus on this list, this due to the fact that the others have many reprints while Gaea's cradle has not.
                        This due to something called the reserved list.
